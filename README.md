#GoVerbal

Tired of navigating the drilldown menu where the congressional record is housed?

Now (or soon) you can do it easy!

#Background
Every so often I completely restart this from scratch.  This will be the last time... check back for a working copy!

#Progress
Bundler installed, first spec copied over

Spec runs on command line after adding spec_helper file and adding VCR, bundler, and RSpec configs.

Spec runs in sublime text after running sublimeText from commandLine instead of Dock.

Created the GoVerbal file.  Runs again!

I had to narrow the scope of my first feature test, so I put "url scraping" to the side for a while, and am now working on "building a nav menu".  So far this is working out well.  Hopefully I will finish this week!

Once again, I have reached the point where my acceptance test is failing but it's not clear why.  So, once again, I narrow the focus of my acceptance test to the GPOSite.

Victory was had with the first acceptance test passing and the ensuing refactoring.  Now, the "big one" is written; that is, enumerating pages of congressional record text.
